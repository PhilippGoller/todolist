# MyAwesomeToDoList

A simple to-do list web app built with React and Redux which I created as part of a student research project.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and navigate into the project directory. Then run the command `npm install` to install all dependencies specified in the `package.json` file. After the installation is complete, you're ready to run the app and start adding tasks to your to-do list!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Starts the dev server. (The server will only listen on localhost. To access your app from other devices on the network use `npm run host`)

### `npm run host`

Starts the dev server exposing the app to external devices on the network.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.

### `npm run preview`

Boots up a web server that serves the files from the `dist` folder.

### `npm run docs`

Generates an API documentation for the app in the `docs` folder using [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/).
